## Introduction
Hi, I'm Adem — a student with interests in Machine Learning, Algorithmic Trading, and Computer Vision, just to name a few. This site is a place where I share a bit about myself, my projects, and the things that interest me. Right now, I’m focused on improving my skills, and in my free time, I enjoy hobbies like weightlifting, golf, and — of course — video games. I’m always learning and curious about many things, so as my mind gets a bit crammed, I hope to use this website as a sort of buffer for all my thoughts and ideas.

## Education
I'm currently 18 years old, completing my Associate’s degree in Computer Science at my local community college while also graduating from high school. This fall, I’ll be entering the University of Washington’s Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering as an incoming junior. In addition to my formal education, I’m constantly learning on the side — recently, I’ve been exploring the basics of quantum computing.

## Experience
I’ve been building projects for over four years, steadily developing my skills — from struggling with simple programs to tackling large-scale projects that span months of work. For the past three years, I’ve also been a core contributor to [FRC Team 488](https://www.xbotrobotics.org/), where I help lead the team’s computer vision and advanced projects subteam. Through both personal and team-based work, I’ve grown not only in technical ability and engineering practices but also in collaboration, leadership, and communication.
